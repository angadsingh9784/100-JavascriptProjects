                <p>While reducing greenhouse gas pollution from energy production, transportation and unsustainable agriculture practices is critical, Scenario 300 is a strategy for going from a dangerous 406 ppm (parts per million) to a safer 300 ppm of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. By regenerating healthy ecosystems, including soils, along with managing local water cycles, we can reverse our disastrous climate course. During this inspiring and informative conference, we will discuss how to rapidly move carbon out of the skies and use it to support a diversity of life both above and below .</p>
